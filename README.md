# Capstone: Beer Recommender System
Author: Steven Addison


## Overview
This project analyzes beer review data of 60,000 unique beers and recommends the top similar styles analyzing Review Text with a tf-idf vectorizer, Style, ABV, and Overall Rating.

## Business Problem
As someone who has spent many years in the restaurant industry I often dread hearing “what do you recommend”, it always has felt like a loaded question to me seeing how one never has enough time to learn about a customer’s likes and taste in order to give accurate guidance. That is why a content-based recommender system such as this one can take all the guessing work out of the equation so that a customer can enjoy a beverage that has been selected for them based on similar items other enthusiasts have previously reviewed and enjoyed.
